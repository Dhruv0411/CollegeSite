          <h1> About </h1>  
	
 <p> The department of Electronics and Telecommunication was established on 30th May 1996. Since its commencement, the primary objective of the
 department has been to impart quality education, training and research at the undergraduate and postgraduate in various areas of Electronics and 
 Telecommunication Engineering with broad emphasis on design aspects of electronic systems.</p>
 <p>The National Board of Accreditation has accredited the department for three years (2009-2012). This department has all the laboratories with modern
 equipment. More than 200 students are seeking professional education in the department under the supervision and guidance of all the staff.</p>
 <p>In 2010, the department had started post graduate course M.Tech Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering with specialization in Digital
 Systems, Approved by AICTE, New Delhi. The Department has always been on a high growth path and has experienced and dedicated faculty with a strong
 commitment to engineering education. To keep pace with the current technological trends, all the undergraduate and postgraduate curricula have been
 upgraded by North Maharashtra University (NMU), Jalgaon regularly.</p>
The course offered is well known for its applied nature including a strong laboratory component and considerable project work. It is designed for 
students who wish to become professional engineers in the fields of electronics and communications engineering. The course emphasizes the importance
 of communication and electronics systems and the applications of principles, developed in the course to the solution of significant practical
problems.Workshop and laboratory facilities are utilized by students for the extensive project work that is a feature of the course. PC and 
workstation based computing laboratories provide tools for electronic circuit simulation and computer-aided design work.
